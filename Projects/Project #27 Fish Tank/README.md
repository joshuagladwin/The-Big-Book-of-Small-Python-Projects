A peaceful animation of a fish tank. Press Ctrl-C to stop.

Similar to [ASCIIQuarium](https://robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/html/) or [@EmojiAquarium](https://twitter.com/EmojiAquarium), but mine is based on an
older ASCII fish tank program for DOS.

## TODO List:

* [ ] Add crabs to the bottom of the tank.
* [ ] Add an ASCII-art castle to the tank.
* [ ] Make fish change speed randomly.
