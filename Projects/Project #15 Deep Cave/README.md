## TODO List:

* [x] ~~Try changing `WIDTH` to 10 or 30.~~

Changes the width of the entire board. When this is smaller than the initial `gap_width` and `left_width`, both are reduced until smaller than `WIDTH`, then the program runs as expected.

* [x] ~~Try changing `PAUSE_AMOUNT` to 0 or 1.0.~~

Changes the time between the each step. 

* [x] ~~Try uncommenting out `ln 40-48`.~~

Changes the size of the hole on each step.
